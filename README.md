# hello-world
My first reposity and my travel of programming.

  I am a junior student from HeFei university of technology(HFUT). In fact, i doesn't want to use github and learn new things. But i knew that the next age is information age and the valuable person is the people who contributes to the conuntry and society. If i want to success, make a bunch of money, meet a beautiful girl, i must learn to use it.
